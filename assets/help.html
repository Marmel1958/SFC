	<p>This app allows your visit to the events of Wittenberg hard to
		plan "Luther's Wedding".</p>
	<p>The app lists all events (Source: Wittenberg city marketing).You
		can select venues. From a distance of about 10 km, there is the
		possibility to choose the next venue of their current location
		automatically. The app also includes a map indicating the venues (and
		possibly their location). Venues can be specifically selected on the
		map.Planning a route from their current Location to your selected
		venue is ife possible.</p>
	<p>Events in the past are red, shown in black in the future.
		Currently running events are shown in green.</p>
	A click on the corresponding entry opens a window with details. A long
	click opens a menu with more options, such as entry into their calendar
	or parts of the event via Twitter or email. The graduation options
	depend on the apps installed on your device.
